# Infantry Basics

## 1. Standard Infantry Tactics
In order to maintain coordination and increase the survival chances of every member in the field one must understand and follow the below tactics:

### 1a. Knowing your squad
It is important for one to know who is who within the squad. Meaning that if the squad has an Anti-Tank Specialist. Know who that Anti-Tank Specialist is, in case he is needed.

### 1b. Listen to your Team Leader/Section Commander/High Commander
It is important to understand and follow the directions of your Team Leader, Section Commander and/or High Commander. The people that fill these roles are usually far more experienced. As detailed in the Unit Organization section (Chapter 0: An Introduction, Section 3: Unit Organzation) found [here](https://handbook.uagpmc.com/ch0/unit-organisation.html#_3-leadership-roles-ranks) one can understand that their roles are to ensure your survival as a team member and making sure that you and your team mates are enjoying your time playing the game with us.

### 1c. Maintaining Distance
It is important that you as a Team Member ensure that you have enough distance between you and another member at all times in any given situation. This is in order to prevent a grenade or machinegun from wiping out the entire team.

### 1d. Mantaining Situational Awareness
It is vital for the team member to keep an eye out for hostile targets, this also includes civilians (if you notice there is civilian presence, call it out). As well as knowing where all friendly targets are located through your Android.

### 1e. Maintaining Security
In combination with Situational Awareness, it is very vital to the survival of the squad that every team member should maintaing a full 360Â° coverage of the area the team is located in. For instance, as the team touches down on the ground through an air insertion, make sure you are covering a sector/area that is not already covered by another member. This will ensure that the team will not be suprised by any hostile elements within the region.

# Drone Operator

## 1. What do, you do as a Drone Operator

As a UAV operator, your job is similar to Reconnaissance to provide overwatch of the battlefield. The difference is you use drones while you are on the battlefield helping the fire team by acting as a rifleman and provide intel on enemy positions.

## 2. Equipment

### 2a. Drones

As a Drone operator, your true friends are actually just robots. While you will have a standard drone (**AR2 Darter**) you use you will also have to use other drones in different situations.

| Mid Range   | Long Range    | Special use     |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| AR2 Darter  | MQ-12 Falcon  | Seafox (USV)    |
| AL6 Pelican | UCAV Sentinel | AH6X Littlebird |
|             | YABHON-R3     | UGV Stomper     |
|             | MQ-9 Reaper   | ED-1D Pelter    |
|             | Burraq UCAV   | ED-1E Roller    |

### 2b. UAV Terminal

Your UAV Terminal is how you talk to your robots and tell them what to do. To connect your UAV terminal to a UAV [**scroll wheel**] and select **open UAV terminal** [**right click**] the UAV you want to control and select **Connect terminal to UAV**. Weirdly the UAV terminal controlls all drones not just UAVs.

### 2c. UAV Battery

Sometimes your portable robots run out of juice so you need to replace their batteries with this item you can recharge them. To recharge your UAV just ACE interact on it and select recharge.

## 3. How to Control your Drone

There are two ways to control your robots manually or automatically.

### 3a. How to Manually Control your Drone

The way you manually control your UAV depends on what type of UAV it is please refer to `...` to learn how to fly rotary and fixed wing aircraft, for UGVs they are driven just like normal vehicles and turrets. The ED variants use special controls, to operate the arm 'Q and E' to go up and down and 'PG up and PG down' for forward and backward. All drones can also open and close doors using telekenisis.

### 3b. How to Control your Drone Autonomously

To control your Drone autonomously open your UAV terminal select the Drone you want to control and [**Shift+Left click**] that places a waypoint onto the map [**Right click**] the point and select your Type, Behavior, and Altitude and your UAV will rise to the set altitude and move to the position and proceed to do what type of operation you told it to do whether that be: loiter, move, land, etc.

## 4. Using the Camera

Using the camera in a Drone is very similar to using a camera in other vehicles like the hunter. You use [**+**] and [**-**] on the numpad to zoom in and out, [**Left click**] to fire your equipped weapon, and [**CTRL+T**] to lock your camera onto one position. pretty damn simple tbh.

## 5. Uses of Special Drones

### 5a. Seafox
The Seafox is an unmaned RHIB with a Bright "Yellow" compartment ontop for target practice and to confuse the enemy
(All UAG Clones are born colour blind to the specific yellow that is used in the compartment paint, operators will see it as orange. We use this specific yellow as it has hypnotic features to whoever sees it and causes them to be confused.)

### 5b. AH6X Littlebird
The AH6X Littlebird is a little bird without a pilot, that's it nothing else is changed we just threw some servos into the cockpit.

### 5c. UGV Stomper
The UGV Stomper is an unmanned ground vehicle that commonly comes with both a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a 40mm grenade machine gun, it is commonly used as a scout vehicle for armadillo,
do not confuse this vehicle with "Aldi" (Automated Logistics Drone) as that is an AI that sometimes comes with resupply and will steal operators if they aren't careful.

### 5d. ED-1D
ED-1D is a small backpack carried ground vehicle attached with a shotgun equipped with 00 buck and slugs used to "disarm" IEDs as well as shoot enemies
no one knows what gauge shotgun this vehicle uses as it was sent down to us from the planet ED along with its brother ED-1E scientists are working hard to figure out who sent us these drones and why.

### 5e. ED-1E
ED-1E is a small backpack carried ground Vehicle attached with a sampling laser and a biopsy probe used to gather data about unknown material.
Like its brother it was sent from planet ED

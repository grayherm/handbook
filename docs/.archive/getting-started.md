# Getting Started

## 1. Recruitment

Join the [Discord](https://uagpmc.com/discord) and ask for a recruiter or message **Cody** `(zeue#0001)`.

## 2. Things to Consider before Recruitment

### 2a. When are our operations?

Our session times are every **Saturday and Sunday at 17:30 UTC** check on the bottom of our [website](https://unnamed.group/) or top-right of our Discord for a countdown to the next one.

### 2b. Can't Attend a Session?

If you cant attend a session during your time as a shiny please contact one of the "helpers" on discord or steam and let them know 24 hours in advance. Note that currently Zyrtex handles attendance for all members and shinies; He should be your first-contact for these matters.

### 2c. Using Premade Loadouts

To use our premade loadouts:

1. Go to [this page](https://unnamed.group/loadouts) and remember the "code" (in square-brackets!)
2. In-game, use the "UAG Arsenal" option on an arsenal box or resupply vehicle
3. Enter the code and click "submit"
4. ???
5. Profit!

### 2d. Restrictions for "Shinies"

Shinies choose their roles after the rest of the group, and will generally be put into more supporting positions such as "bitch boy" (ammo bearer) or a regular rifleman. They are also required to use the gear provided by our **premade loadouts** (detailed above) but may change any aesthetics of their loadout. Shinies are also not allowed to take on more critical roles in a session, for example: pilots, drivers, leaders, specialists, rp-helpers, etc.

### 2f. Recruitment Process

As a shiny, you will attend (on average) **three** sessions before we can consider you a full member. We use internal voting to decide whether or not we extend your recruitment, kick you out, or allow you to join based off of your attitude towards other players.

## 3. Modpack Setup

Setting up the modpack is easy, but is quite unique from traditional setups. Because of this, we ask that you follow every step in this guide in order to properly download all of the mods and ensure you can jump into sessions without any issues.

We ask you to **please make sure to read all the points before you begin installation.**

### 3a. Installing

Oh shit, a video!

1. **Add Cody** on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/codyburton/) to gain access to the private mod. If you click the link make sure to **login to Steam** through the browser.

2. **Once Cody accepts your Friend Request** subscribe to our setup mod called the **Primary Session Branch** on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092924095), this essentially keeps track of all other required mod items and allows for quick install and update.

3. Open up the ArmA III launcher and select the **Mods** tab and select **Unload All** in the top-right if you have any mods already enabled.

4. Under **Available Mods** enable the **Primary Session Branch** mod and then select the **Load Selected Mods** option to subscribe to and load our entire modpack.

5. Wait for the launcher to download and enable the mods and then youâ€™re all done!

### 3b. Updating

Updating the modpack is simple! All you need to do is restart your **ArmA III Launcher**, **Unload All** mods, then reload the **Primary Session Branch** mod you downloaded to begin with.

### 3c. Uninstalling

**Unload All** the mods, select **More** and then select **Unsubscribe From All Mods**. if you can't do so then unsubscribe from all the mods manually.

## 4. Advanced Combat Radio Environment 2 (ACRE2)

Installing and setting up ACRE2 is easy! When we use ACRE2 it is automatically installed in our modpack and **once you launch the game it will automatically set up in your TeamSpeak 3 client!** All you need to do is just **enable the plugin** found in **Tools-> Options-> Addons** of your TS3 client - In case you have TFAR installed **make sure to disable it within the TS3 Client.**

## 5. Joining the Server

Before joining the server you are required to do two things:

### 5a. Disable BattlEye

To disable Battleye open your ArmA III launcher, go on BattlEye and untick "Enable BattlEye anti-cheat software"

### 5b. Change your Profile name

You are required to change your ingame profile name to the shortened name assigned to you when you joined the unit. If you are unable to change the profile name, please create a new one with the name assigned. This simply used for identification purposes.

## 6. Configuration

### 6a. Enhanced Movement

In order to use the Enhanced Movement mod i.e climbing over walls or strategically using people as stools, you are required to assign a key of your choice to it. In order to do this go into the 'Options' menu, 'Controls' and then find 'Custom Controls' in the dropdown menu. Find "Use Action 1" and add your preferred key. The recommended key is the backslash '\' button.

### 6b. Grenade Use

It is recommended to set the keybinding for grenades (when throwing them) to "double-tapping" the 'g' key.

## 7. Default Mod Keybindings

To open your Android press 'H'.

To open your Android to interact with it, hold down the 'Left Control' button and press 'H'.

To use Ace Interact, hold down the 'Windows' key.

To use Ace Medical on someone, hold down the 'Windows' key while looking at the person.

To use Ace Medical on yourself, hold down both the 'Left Control' button and the 'Windows' key.

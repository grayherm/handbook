# Code of Conduct

The most important thing you must know and agree to in order to be in UAG is our **Code of Conduct**. The rules in this document must be followed by all members of UAG regardless of their position to ensure everyone has a great time here. **Failure to follow any of these rules may result in termination of membership with the group.**

## 1. Don't be a Cunt

This rule should be pretty straightforward, but some still slip up on this one. We are here to have a good time with friends, not to be bullied and harassed by people online. There is a lot of "banter" in the group, as that's the environment we enjoy the most, but sometimes people can take it too far and in those cases we crack down hard on those who ignore multiple warnings to stop.

Here are some brief examples of what we're talking about:

- **If you're told to stop, fucking stop.** Don't take it as an insult, just drop it and move on.
- **Do not bring people's families into things** in a malicious manner, keep shit civil.
- **Don't be an edge-lord.** It's just stupid, stop it, get some help.

If you need any further information regarding this rule, please contact Cody on Discord.

## 2. Discord Guidelines

We use Discord outside of sessions to coordinate and communicate with everyone much easier than the Steam or TeamSpeak-only alternatives. By using Discord, you already agree to following the [guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines), so as a unit hosted primarily on Discord we expect everyone to follow these guidelines by default.

## 3. Third-Party Advertisement

"Third-party" refers specifically to other units or communities that you are personally involved with. Referential language when talking about other communities is tolerated for obvious reasons, but any discussions about other groups is frowned upon in official UAG communication channels. 

### 3a. Member "Poaching"

This is obviously strictly prohibited under any circumstances unless authorized by Cody himself, and will usually end in a ban of some sort for those involved.

### 3b. Self Promotion

This refers to promoting your own content. Whether that be a twitch stream, other discords that you own, personal products or businesses will not be tolerated. If you would like to share any social media please contact a helper to get permission.

# Section 1: Getting Started

## 1. Recruitment

Join the [Discord](https://uagpmc.com/discord) and ask for a recruiter or message **Cody** `(zeue#0001)`.

## 2. Modpack Setup

Setting up the modpack is easy, but is quite unique from traditional setups. Because of this, we ask that you follow every step in this guide in order to properly download all of the mods and ensure you can jump into sessions without any issues.

### 2a. Installing

- Add Cody on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/codyburton/) to gain access to the private mod.
- Subscribe to our setup mod on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092924095), this essentially keeps track of all other required mod items and allows for quick install and update.
- Open up the Arma 3 launcher and select the “MODS” tab and select “Unload all” in the top-right if you have any mods already enabled.
- Under “Available mods” enable our workshop item and then select the “Load selected mods” option to subscribe to and load our entire modpack.
- Wait for the launcher to download and enable the mods and then you’re all done!

### 2b. Updating

Updating the modpack is simple! All you need to do is restart your Arma 3 Launcher, unload all mods, then reload the setup mod you downloaded to begin with.

As a recruit you must attend two operations before we can consider you a full member. We use internal voting to decide whether or not we extend your recruitment, kick you out, or allow you to join based off of your attitude towards other players.

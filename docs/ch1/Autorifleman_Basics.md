# Section 1: Autorifleman Basics

## 1. Introduction

The role of an Autorifleman is a pretty simple thing to do. As an Autorifleman you surpress the enemy and cover your team.

## 2. The Difference Between Supressive fire and Cover fire.

Both covering fire and suppressive fire involves lobbing an extreme amount of bullets toward the enemies (Or at least the general direction of the enemies).

But covering fire is done when you’re trying to steer enemy’s fire away from something that you don’t want them to pockmark, for example: A medic conducting field first aid on a wounded personnel.

Suppressive fire, on the other hand, means that no one is needing cover: The only thing that you want to need cover is the enemies.

The idea is to make a storm of metal so intense that the enemies don’t even dare to even poke their head out of their covers, let alone returning fire. This will impede their motions and buy time for air support or more final solutions to finish them off, or to allow units to maneuver closer to them to get more of a fighting edge.

Suppressive fire is to prevent enemies from mobilising or to conduct their operations efficiently.

Both have to do with mobilisation and operating, which are all vital to a fight. A combat unit who can mobilise more freely and operating more efficiently will usually emerge victorious over opponents who are starved of the two things above.
## 3. Equipment

### 3a. Your gun

Your gun is your most used tool its what goes shooty shooty bang bang. Your basic M249 weighs about 15 pounds so its a heavy boi. The M249 forms the basis of firepower for the fire team. The gunner has the option of using 30-round Stanag mags or 200-round mags. The M249's maximum effective range is around 1 klick but most of the time you will be within 500 meters.

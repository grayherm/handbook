# Section 1: Autorifleman Basics

## 1. Introduction

The role of an Autorifleman is a pretty simple thing to do. As an Autorifleman you surpress the enemy and cover your team.

## 2. The Difference Between Supressive fire and Cover fire.

Both covering fire and suppressive fire involves lobbing an extreme amount of bullets toward the enemies (Or at least the general direction of the enemies).

But covering fire is done when you’re trying to steer enemy’s fire away from something that you don’t want them to pockmark, for example: A medic conducting field first aid on a wounded personnel.

Let’s say the scenario is happening in an active warzone and there are leads flying everywhere. The guy in the back will spray his rifle toward the enemies in the hope that they will target him instead of the medic who’s busy with the casualty a little behind, or at least make their fires a bit less accurate to ease up the bullets endangering the medic who’s doing his/her job.

Covering fire is done to support another unit/personnel with their operation and/or mobilisation.

Suppressive fire, on the other hand, means that no one is needing cover: The only thing that you want to need cover is the enemies.

The idea is to make a storm of metal so intense that the enemies don’t even dare to even poke their head out of their covers, let alone returning fire. This will impede their motions and buy time for air support or more final solutions to finish them off, or to allow units to maneuver closer to them to get more of a fighting edge.

Usually, a unit would only end suppressing when this happens, and it happens a lot:

Suppressive fire is to prevent enemies from mobilising or to conduct their operations efficiently.

Both have to do with mobilisation and operating, which are all vital to a fight. A combat unit who can mobilise more freely and operating more efficiently will usually emerge victorious over opponents who are starved of the two things above.

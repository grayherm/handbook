### 3a. Section Commander

The role of the Section Commander is to streamline communication between the Team Leaders of the section with High Command through a command chain as displayed in the UAG Orbat at the top of this page. Furthermore the Section Command is there to coordinate all teams of the section towards the objective as strategically as possible while ensuring the flow of information between all teams is as clear as possible.

The main goals of the Section Commander in UAG are as follows:

1. The Section Commander must ensure that the flow of information between High Command and the section is clear as possible.

2. The Section Commander must ensure that all teams are alive and well and knows their exact location through the constant use of the Android provided.

3. The Section Commander must ensure that the teams are pursuing their objectives and following orders.

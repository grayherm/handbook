# UAV Operator

## 1. What do, you do as a UAV Operator

As a UAV operator, your job is similar to Reconnaissance to provide overwatch of the battlefield. The difference is you use drones while you are on the battlefield helping the fire team by acting as a rifleman and provide intel on enemy positions.

## 2. Equipment

### 2a. Drones

As a UAV operator, your true friends are actually just robots. While you will have a standard drone (**AR2 Darter**) you use you will also have to use other drones in different situations.

| Mid Range   | Long Range    | Special use     |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| AR2 Darter  | MQ-12 Falcon  | Seafox (USV)    |
| AL6 Pelican | UCAV Sentinel | AH6X Littlebird |
|             | YABHON-R3     | UGV Stomper     |
|             | MQ-9 Reaper   | ED-1D Pelter    |
|             | Burraq UCAV   | ED-1E Roller    |

### 2b. UAV Terminal

Your UAV Terminal is how you talk to your robots and tell them what to do. To connect your UAV terminal to a UAV [**scroll wheel**] and select **open UAV terminal** [**right click**] the UAV you want to control and select **Connect terminal to UAV**.

### 2c. UAV Battery

Sometimes your portable robots run out of juice so you need to replace their batteries with this item you can recharge them. To recharge your UAV just ACE interact on it and select recharge.

## 3. How to Control your UAV

There are two ways to control your robots manually or automatically.

### 3a. How to Manually Control your UAV

The way you manually control your UAV depends on what type of UAV it is please refer to `...` to learn how to fly rotary and fixed wing aircraft, for UGVs they are driven just like normal vehicles and turrets the ED varriants have some special controls to controll the arm 'q and e' to go up and down and 'pg up and pg down' for forward and backward the ED varrients can also open and close doors using telekenisis.

### 3c. How to Control your UAV Autonomously

To control your UAV autonomously open your UAV terminal select the UAV you want to control and [**Shift+Left click**] that places a waypoint onto the map [**Right click**] the point and select your Type, Behavior, and Altitude and your UAV will rise to the set altitude and move to the position and proceed to do what type of operation you told it to do whether that be: loiter, move, land, etc.

## 4. Using the Camera

Using the camera in a UAV is very similar to using a camera in other vehicles like the hunter. You use [**+**] and [**-**] on the numpad to zoom in and out, [**Left click**] to fire your equipped weapon, and [**CTRL+T**] to lock your camera onto one position. pretty damn simple tbh.

## 5. Uses of Special UAVs

### 5a. Seafox
The Seafox is an unmaned RHIB with a Bright "Yellow" compartment ontop for target practice and to confuse the enemy
(All UAG Clones are born colour blind to the specific yellow that is used in the compartment paint operators will see it as orange. We use this specific yellow as it has hypnotic features to whoever sees it and causes them to be confused.)

### 5b. Ah6x Littlebird
The Ah6x Littlebird is a little bird without a driver, thats it nothing else is changed we just threw some servos into the cockpit.

### 5c. UGV Stomper
The UGV Stomper is an unmaned ground vehicle that commonly comes with a 12.7mm auto cannon as well as a 40mm HE launcher this is commonly used as a scout vehicle for armadillo,
do not confuse this vehicle with "Aldi" (Automated Logistics Drone) as that is an AI that sometimes comes with resupply and will steal operators if they arnt careful.

### 5d. ED-1D
ED-1D is a small personal carry ground vehicle attached with a shotgun equipped with 00 buck and slugs used to "disarm" IEDs as well as shoot enemies
no one knows what gauge shotgun this vehicle uses as it was sent down to us from the planet ED along with its brother ED-1E scientists are working hard to figure out who sent us these drones and why.

### 5e. ED-1E
ED-1E is a small personal carry ground Vehicle attached with a sampiling laser and a biopsy probe used to gather data about unknown material.
Like its brother it was sent from planet ED

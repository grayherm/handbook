# Reconnaissance Team

## What is Recon?
The reconnaissance team is a support unit made of two men, a shooter and a spotter, they work under Command and alongside the section. The main use of a recon unit is to provide over watch and support for the section as they move in and secure objectives, but most importantly to provide the section commander with up to date information about the upcoming objectives. While a good reconnaissance team is very useful to have, it isn't everyone's cup of tea; we primarily operate at a mid - long-range reconnaissance unit armed with long range rifles, due to this we spend quite a bit of time navigating to new over watch positions and waiting for the section to secure objectives.

## Equipment
As recon we primarily use marksman rifles. Our rifle choice will differ depending on the scenario, depending on the distance and terrain we're face with we will have to adapt our weapon choices. The below weapons are our standard rifles, these can be adapted or switched out depending on the situation:

| Mid Range | Long Range        | Special use  | 
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Mk14 ERB  | L115A3            | Barrett M107 |  
| Cyrus     | M200 Intervention |              |  

Additional equipment that we take is a 152 Radio so that we can communicate with both command and the section lead. A range card, this will update for your equipped gun. AtragMx along with a kestrel and Vector 21 Nite, these three devices will help us effectively determine a zeroing range. Depending on your weight a SSWT kit can be useful to allow you the ability to bipod your weapon anywhere. The AtragMx will allow us to input various variables to determine what our zeroing should be, this is mainly useful at longer range to save time, at a shorter range you can eyeball the zeroing but only for up to around 300m-400m. I will go into depth about the use of each of these equipment below. 

**Kestrel**

The Kestrel is a device that will provide you with the current atmospheric variables, this includes the wind speed, current temperature, humidity and barom pressure. all of these variables will be able to affect your shots at greater distances. After you have noted all of the variables down you can input them into the respective areas on the AtragMx.

**Vector 21 Nite**

The Vector 21 Nite is a night vision variant of the Vector 21. only one Vector is needed and is primarily going to be used by the spotter as it can input directly into the Atrag. The shooter should take a longer range rangefinder, like the soflam. While using the Vector you can hold **Tab** + **R** and it will measure both the range and the elevation of you from the target and input the numbers into the Atrag to save you the time.

**AtragMx**

The AtragMx is where all of the information gathered with the above two devices will be input. When you open the Atrag you will need to choose the accurate gun from the gun list, once that is done you need to input the atmospheric variables and the target variables. Wind direction which can be seen by toggling an overlay with **Shift** + **K** is an additional variable that is defined by what clock position it is heading. The Target menu is where you will input your wind speeds and direction. The targets distance and elevation will already be there if you've used a Vector 21.


### Uniform

Light clothing and armour is preferable when moving in a recon unit, however some cases we may find it advantageous to use ghillie suits. Our ammunition tends to weigh more than the regular rifleman, so cutting back on other unessential pieces of equipment in your uniform is helpful.


## Recon in the field

At the start of an operation we will be informed of the plan for the session. We will usually head in a bit before the section so that we can provide a recon report to the FTLs and SL. Before heading into the field we will decide on over watch locations for the different objectives that we will be taking and head to our first position.
After we have arrived at our first position one person will start working on a recon report for the team leads while the other works on getting the zeroing set for the shooter. After that it is very straight forward, we will provide over watch on the objectives along with support fire while moving to new over watch positions as the section advances; providing recon reports and updates as needed.

We report to HQ directly, all of our orders need to come from HQ but if the section asks for assistance in certain matters and we feel we can or its the best position to move to we will first gain approval from HQ.

We will arrange for our exfil usually with the section, but if we are too far out we will arrange with air core and command to leave the area

Pretty much it tbh, recon is a fairly straight forward role, with some complicated aspects in regards to your distance and other aspects. It isn't for everyone and many find it can be a boring role as it can be a lot of sitting around, but once the shooting starts, it feels great. **Green team best team**

# Using the Handbook

The UAG handbook can sometimes be complicated to navigate and use quickly and effectively, so we have taken steps to try and make it more user-friendly, but we're terrible at this so feel free to leave feedback on our GitLab or Discord!

## Structure

The handbook is currently using the following structure:

```
Front Page
 |
 \
  Chapter # <-- Collection of topics
   |
   \
    Section # <-- Topic, collection of points
     |
     \
      Article # <-- Point, where the information is
```

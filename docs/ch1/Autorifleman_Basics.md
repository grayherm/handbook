# Section 1: Autorifleman Basics

## 1. Introduction

The role of an Autorifleman is a pretty simple thing to do. As an Autorifleman you surpress the enemy and cover your team.

## 2. The Difference Between Surpressive fire and Cover fire.

Both surpressive fire and cover fire involve lobbing a shit ton of bullets towards a certain postion. Cover fire is used for when you want to keep the enemys fire away from a certain postion, bassically distract the enemy towards your postion so another postion can do their own thing. Surpressive fire on the other hand is to keep an enemy pinned down and unable to move or conduct their operations efficiently.

## 3. Basics of Surpressive fire and Cover fire

### 3a. Surpressive fire

As stated above surpressive fire is to pin the enemy down, three round bursts every two seconds or so on an enemy position is a basic rule of thumb on how to surpress the enemy whether that is to move forward in a shoot and scoot formation or just to hold down a postion.

### 3b. Cover fire

To cover fire just do what ever it takes to take the enemys attention away from something whether it is to let a medic do his job or allow for evac. Basically just shoot untill they shoot at you.

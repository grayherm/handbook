# Section 2: UAV Operator

## 1. What do, you do as a UAV Operator

As a UAV operator, your job is similar to Reconnaissance to provide overwatch of the battlefield. The difference is you use drones while you are on the battlefield helping the fire team by acting as a rifleman and provide intel on enemy postions.

## 2. Equipment

As a UAV operator your true friends are actually just robots. While you will have a standerd drone (**AR2 Darter**) you use you will also have to use other drones in different situations.

# Using this Handbook

Welcome to the official UAG handbook! Here you will find everything UAG-related that we could be bothered to write down.

The handbook is organised into chapters, which are sorted in ascending order of complexity. You can see all of the chapters on the left sidebar if you are on desktop, or in the menu to the top left if you are on mobile.

You're currently in Chapter 0 of the handbook, our "Fundamentals" chapter, which we expect every single member of the unit to read through completely, as well as all updates that we announce on the Discord. We do not expect you to continue reading past this chapter, but feel free to do so at your own leisure.

> **NOTE:** _More complex roles, such as leaders, pilots, or artillerymen may be requested to read through further chapters._

Now, let's get you started on finishing this chapter! Navigate to the bottom-right of the page and click the link to go to the next chapter.

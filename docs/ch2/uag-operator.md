# Section 2: UAV Operator

## 1. What do, you do as a UAV Operator

As a UAV operator, your job is similar to Reconnaissance to provide overwatch of the battlefield. The difference is you use drones while you are on the battlefield helping the fire team by acting as a rifleman and provide intel on enemy positions.

## 2. Equipment

### 2a. Drones

As a UAV operator, your true friends are actually just robots. While you will have a standard drone (**AR2 Darter**) you use you will also have to use other drones in different situations.

| Mid Range  | Long Range        | Special use       | 
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AR2 Darter | MQ-12 Falcon      | Seafox (USV)      |  
| AL6 Pelican| UCAV Sentinel     | AH6X Littlebird   |
|            | YABHON-R3         | UGV Stomper       | 
|            | MQ-9 Reaper       |                   |

### 2b. UAV Terminal

Your UAV Terminal is how you talk to your robots and tell them what to do. To connect your UAV terminal to a UAV [**scroll wheel**] and select **open UAV terminal** [**right click**] the UAV you want to control and select **Connect terminal to UAV**.

### 2c. UAV Battery

Sometimes your portable robots run out of juice so you need to replace their batteries with this item you can recharge them. To recharge your UAV just ACE interact on it and select recharge.

## 3. How to Control your UAV

There are two ways to control your robots manually or automatically.

### 3a. How to Manually Control your UAV

The way you manually control your UAV depends on what type of UAV it is please refer to `...` to learn how to fly rotary and fixed wing aircraft

### 3b. How to Control your UAV Autonomously

To control your UAV autonomously open your UAV terminal select the UAV you want to control and [**Shift+Left click**] that places a waypoint onto the map [**Right click**] the point and select your Type, Behavior, and Altitude and your UAV will rise to the set altitude and move to the position and proceed to do what type of operation you told it to do whether that be: loiter, move, land, etc.

## 4. Using the Camera

Using the camera in a UAV is very similar to using a camera in other vehicles like the hunter. You use [**+**] and [**-**] on the numpad to zoom in and out, [**Left click**] to fire your equipped weapon, and [**CTRL+T**] to lock your camera onto one position. pretty damn simple tbh.

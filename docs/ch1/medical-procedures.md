# Section 2: Medical Procedures


## 1. Introduction
Real UAG men use the Ace3 medical system, so here’s what you need to know to survive and stay healthy. * Even as a basic rifleman, you will be required to know at least the basics of the ace medical system and what to do in different situations to - you know - not let people die.

## 2. Controls and UI
To treat yourself, self-interact using Ctrl + Win. To treat someone else, use Win. 
Navigate to the medical section of the patient, and you will be able to see their current status of individual body parts and their medical history.
When your screen is pulsing with a red-blue effect, that means you’re in pain
When your vision loses colour, you’re low on blood
When you hear a heartbeat, your pulse is low

## 3. Common Injuries
Out of the many injuries that you may encounter, a common one will be velocity, which occurs when you get shot or damaged by shrapnel. Other wounds include Avulsions, Contusions, Abrasions and more.

## 4. Medical equipment
You will have access to a variety of medical equipment during the ops, so it is important to know which one does what.

### 4a. Bandages
There are 4 main types of bandages you can use with ace; Field dressings, Packing bandages, elastic bandages, and QuickClot. Here is a chart to show the effectiveness of each on different wounds.

Elastics are very efficient in closing wounds, but only temporarily as they will almost certainly re-open. QuickClot on the other hand is very efficient in keeping wounds closed

### 4b. Kits

There are two kits that are available: The PAK (Personal Aid Kit) and the Surgical Kit
The Surgical Kit is carried and used by the medic, and it is used to stitch up wounds that reopen. One surgical kit has multiple uses
The PAK is for fully healing someone, restoring their heart rate and blood pressure. The PAK is one use, and fairly heavy, meaning it should only be used when the patient is either heavily wounded to the point that using a PAK will waste fewer resources that fully bandaging the patient, or when they are down, with no heart rate, etc. The speed of PAKing someone varies depending on their state; if they’re heavily wounded it will take longer.

### 4c. Other

Tourniquets are very important not to make your medic descend into madness. They can be applied to limbs, where they stop bleeding. They are only a temporary solution; keeping one on for longer than 5 minutes will cause immense amounts of pain, but at least you won’t lose blood as fast.
Blood bags – pretty obvious, they restore blood in a patient. You can only use a blood bag on someone else, so if you’re low, just ask anyone to give you a transfusion. There are 250, 500 and 1000ml variants.
Morphine will suppress pain, but will also decrease the heart rate of the patient
Epinephrine will increase the heart rate

## 5. Treatment Procedure

### 5a. Self Treatment

In almost any situation putting on tourniquets is a good idea, with the exception of light damage to one or two limbs.** Remember that tourniquets will stop the limb it is applied to from bleeding, so you’ll have more time to patch yourself up before bleeding out
Before treating yourself or anyone else, you need to identify the situation. In the middle of a firefight and without cover, it is not a good idea to stand and give yourself a full medical operation. 
When in cover, you can begin to patch yourself up. Using elastic bandages when you need to travel somewhere immediately or can’t take the time to properly bandage your wounds. Keep in mind elastic bandages have a high chance of reopening
If you can, using QuickClot for any wounds is recommended.
And remember to remove all tourniquets after you’re done**
When you are no longer bleeding, check your blood pressure. A good blood pressure is around 120/80. If you are low, ask someone to give you a blood transfusion depending on how much blood you’ve lost.
Tourniquets will affect the blood pressure reading**
If you are in pain and your heart rate is normal (between 50 and 100) then you can use a morphine autoinjector.
Autoinjectors will not work if applied to a limb with a tourniquet on**
The result should be you’re alive and ready to continue.

### 5b. Treatment
If the patient is unresponsive, make sure you’re in a safe position and notify someone of the situation.
Check if they’re not dead by looking at your Android. There should still be a marker on their position if they’re alive. If they are, continue. Otherwise, your job is done.
First, check their pulse. If there is none, provide CPR and apply tourniquets to damaged limbs and stabilize the patient. If the patient has no pulse, skip to step 3.
After removing the tourniquets, check their blood pressure and use a blood bag if it is too low. The patient should be awake, or waking soon, as long as they still have a pulse... yeah you should probably check that again.
Use a PAK if the patient is still unresponsive/has no pulse.

## 6. Tips
Use Tourniquets or our medic will be sad
Remove tourniquets when you’re done
Only use a PAK when it is really needed.
Don’t overdose on morphine. Remember: Overdose = Comatose

## 7. TL;DR
Elastics for temporary, QuickClot for lasting
You get booboo? Tourniquet and fix
Don’t keep a tourniquet on for too long
In pain? Morphine
Someone is down and has no heart rate? Bandage and PAK them
Stay woke, stay frosty.
